# seusmbon

Files associated with the Southeast United States Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (SEUSMBON). Samples are collected through the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration (SFER) cruises. This project seeks to integrate ground and satellite observations related to biodiversity to inform ecosystem-based management in and around the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS).

The structure of this repository is:

* code – scripts and/or Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and figure generation
* figures – pre-publication versions of figures
* markdown – study questions, sample descriptions, analysis notes, and results
* metadata – sample data and other metadata, prepared in standard format for database submission
* tourmaline – config, manifest, and metadata files for Tourmaline runs, plus links to full Tourmaline output on Zenodo
